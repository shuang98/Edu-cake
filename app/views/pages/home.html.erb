        About Us: 
        <br><br>
The Problem<br><br>
Studies show that extracurriculars are beneficial to students in many ways such as raising their self-esteem,  teaching them time management, and allowing them to explore their interests. However, currently, not all students have the same access to these extracurriculars. Students from more privileged backgrounds can afford to pay for extra classes in areas like music and dance, while other students are not able to participate. Although the education gap with respect to the difference between schools is obvious, this is another educational inequality that we wanted to address with our idea.
<br><br>
Educake is a platform for people to create and take courses about topics that they are interested in. While most course websites are meant to be purely educational, offering students a way to learn about technical topics such as programming and math from accredited universities, Educake is for anything that anyone is interested in.
<br><br>
Anyone can make a course with our website using our straightforward course editor. This allows people who love a certain topic to share their interest to the world by creating a course. On the other hand, people taking courses can figure out what interests them and learn something that is cool to them. We want to make learning a piece of cake.
